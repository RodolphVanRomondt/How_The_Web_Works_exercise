*** PART ONE ***

HTTP is a protocol that defines how web pages should communicate

a URL is the human readable address that we use to locate a specific resource

DNS is a system that map the IP address of a device to the human readable address

a Query String is the string we/the browsers pass to the URL to search for something

GET is to retrieve/request data. POST also requests data, however, it also has a side effect

an HTTP request is a request from a client to a server
    
an HTTP response is the response to the HTTP request from a server to a client

Headers have additional information that the browsers use to communicate and set up things

DNS is use to get the IP address of the server
using the IP address the browser makes an HTTP request with the necessary info
the server sends back an HTTP response
the browser renders the HTML
